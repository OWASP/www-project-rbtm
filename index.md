This project will be a collection of different red/blue threat modeling cases. Each case will provide a scenario with a threat model, and the participants will take on the role as attacker or defender, and compete. This will serve as a tool for security people to utilize in order to drive engagement on the important topic of threat modeling. 

### Road Map
2024 H1 - One or more cases added to the repository, ready to be played
2024 H2 - Define a roadmap
